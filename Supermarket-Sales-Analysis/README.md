## 🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis
A complete **Python** data analysis project exploring and visualizing **Supermarket Sales Data**.  
This project walks through the full analytics process — from data cleaning and preprocessing to visualization and extracting insights.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze supermarket sales data and discover useful business insights.  
Through the analysis, we’ll answer questions like:
- Which **product lines** generate the highest revenue?  
- How do **sales differ across branches**?  
- What’s the relationship between **customer type, payment method, and total sales**?  
- Which **times or days** have the highest sales volume?

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** → Numerical calculations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Development environment
